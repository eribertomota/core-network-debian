The CORE project was derived from the open source IMUNES project from the
University of Zagreb in 2004. In 2006, changes for CORE were released back to
that project, some items of which were adopted. Marko Zec <zec@fer.hr> is the
primary developer from the University of Zagreb responsible for the IMUNES
(GUI) and VirtNet (kernel) projects. Ana Kukec and Miljenko Mikuc are known
contributors.

Jeff Ahrenholz <jeffrey.m.ahrenholz@boeing.com> has been the primary Boeing
developer of CORE, and has written this manual. Tom Goff
<thomas.goff@boeing.com> designed the Python framework and has made significant
contributions. Claudiu Danilov <claudiu.b.danilov@boeing.com>, Gary Pei
<guangyu.pei@boeing.com>, Phil Spagnolo, and Ian Chakeres have contributed code
to CORE. Dan Mackley <daniel.c.mackley@boeing.com> helped develop the CORE API,
originally to interface with a simulator. Jae Kim <jae.h.kim@boeing.com> and
Tom Henderson <thomas.r.henderson@boeing.com> have supervised the project and
provided direction.
